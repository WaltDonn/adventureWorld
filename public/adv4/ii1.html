		<p>You go left, your boots sloshing through the foul water. Suddenly, you hear a large rush of water, and you are suddenly surged under the disgusting water by a large wave of sludge. Your torch is extinguished and your mouth fills with the horrible liquid. Eventually you are able to get your head above the water, coughing and spitting. You grab a hold of a chink in the wall. After some time, the water settles and you are able to stand. You are unsure where you are, and you have no source of light.</p>
