		<p>There is a hole in the sewer wall, through which you see the lights. You see that they are enchanted lights often used in the kingdom's mines. You suspect that the gas in the sewer entered through this hole. The gas is toxic and is likely the reason the sewer and rats have begun to contract the plague. But to report this would be costly for the kingdom, as mining would have to be on hold while the walls are repaired. What do you do?</p>
