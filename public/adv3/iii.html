		<p>You travel through the maze for what seems like hours until you finally arrive at a large room with blazing torches. In the center of the room is an empty bowl, and across the wall is the following message: "Blood for destruction, spit for fame, holy water for safety". There seem to be no exits out of the room.</p>
