		<p>As your blood enters the bowl, you hear a large crash. The maze disappears like mist and you can see fire coming from the capital city nearby. A large rock seems to have come from the sky and wiped out a large chunk of the fortifications. Screams and cries can be heard coming from the city as you return. Destruction has been unleashed, and it will take some time for the kingdom to get back to the way it was before.</p>
