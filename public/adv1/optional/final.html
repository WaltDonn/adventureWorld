        <h2>The Sickness</h2>
    </div><div class="adv">
		<p>The blood of the rat seeps into the altar and the door begins to glow! It rolls aside to reveal massive amount of wealth! You bring back the money to the kingdom, as there is far too much gold and jewels for any one person to possess. Perhaps the source of the sickness was not found, but with the treasure the king will surely be able to make up for this year's bad harvest. Congratulations!</p>
