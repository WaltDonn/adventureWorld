		<p>The battle is intense, and you have several small cuts on your body in seconds. The spear of the Queen seems almost invisible as she fights, it takes everything you have to dodge her quick attacks. You rarely have time to make an attack with her quick jabs and sudden swings. You don't have much more energy in you. Time to make a decision.</p>
