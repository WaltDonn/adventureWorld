		<p>You catch up and tackle the hooded figure. Taking off the hood reveals the ugly, angry face of a snarling goblin. A piece of paper falls out of his pocket, revealing plans to assassinate one of the warriors participating in the tournament! Reporting this would you put you in the favor of the king, but the tournament would likely have to be canceled, causing a massive loss of money for the kingdom. What do you do?</p>
