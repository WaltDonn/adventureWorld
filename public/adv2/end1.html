		<p>The king is glad you told him about the plans, but as predicted the tournament must be canceled, which takes a heavy chunk of gold out of the treasury. The people are disappointed that the festivities have come to a halt, but luckily the goblin plan was thwarted and no lives were lost. Congratulations!</p>
